# SABLS Explorer

This is a tool for browsing COD Black Ops 3 audio archives

This is a pretty hacky mess, I mostly wanted to get it usable enough and not have it spend all of eternity on my drive.\
    I intend on making improvements, but I also want to play minecraft so who knows

#### Dependencies:
* Python 3.10 or greater (there are match-case statements because I think they're nicer than the if-elif-else alternative)
* PySide6
