# The Super Official License

You (the person/organization reading this license) are mostly free to do whatever you want with this project

By using or modifying the materials in this project, (thereby creating your project) you agree to this license
#
You agree to interpret this license as it is plainly written, no legal shenanigans as I (the person writing this license) am not a lawyer. Terms in parentheses are to offer extra clarification and/or definition, not optional details

You agree to respect this license

If you make changes that you feel are worth sharing and/or distributing, you agree to make your project public. This means your source code, build scripts and any related assets are hosted publicly for all to freely access.

You are free to relicense your project, as long as your license is compatible with the term above (starting on line 11 in the markdown file)

You acknowledge that this license may be updated to be more accurate or clear in wording or intent (or to improve the markdown formatting), and that you agree to comply with the latest iteration of this license.

You acknowledge that this project may be relicensed. You are free to use the project as it would have been available, but this does not grandfather you into any future development. Note that updating this license does not qualify as relicensing this project. (Relicensing means changing to a different license such as GPLv3 or MIT, not fixing typos or providing clarification to this one)

If you violate this agreement:
* You agree to buy me (the maintainers of this project) a lot of weed (2.5oz+ per maintainer)
* You agree to buy our legal team 3+ rounds at their favorite bar
* You agree that any person included in the above may swap for their preferred libation, though ypu must cover a monetarily equal amount if it. (eg: if a maintainer would rather have chocolate, you agree to spend the equivalent of 2.5oz of marijuana on their chocolate)
* You agree to cover all costs (eg: legal fees) incurred enforcing this agreement

You agree that any potential litigation is to be done at the convenience of the maintainers of this project

Please consider linking back to this project in an appropriate place in your project. Emailing me (the owner of this project) is fine too. This is entirely at your discretion, I just find it neat when people can use my work.

If you monetize/commercialize your project, please consider compensating the maintainers of this project. This is also at your discretion.

Thanks for your time
